I was born and raised on Legos, Calvin and Hobbes, and oatmeal in Oakland, California. To be honest, I didn't know I wanted to be a mechanical engineer until I touched my first milling machine before I went to UCLA. Since then, I've been building things for almost ten years, and I've been fortunate to be in places where I've gotten to enjoy my work wholeheartedly. While my experiences have mainly revolved around robotics, my core is always centered on design and manufacturing, and I'm looking forward to getting the chance to apply my skills in even areas that I am unfamiliar with---robots, cars, drones, planes, rockets, 3D printers, consumer products, really anything. I'm always excited for learning opportunities that life sends my way! Besides engineering, I am an avid exercise junkie, whether it be going to the gym, climbing fake rocks, running, or shooting arrows.
