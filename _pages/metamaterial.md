During the summer of 2018, I joined Professor Jonathan Hopkinsâ€™s UCLA Flexible Research Group to expand on a project I started in his graduate course. Refusing to abandon a great idea after the class ended, I used the phase changes of gallium to develop a metamaterial with programmable stiffness properties. My work on this project was posted in Advanced Science News. You can read the article [here](https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/phase-changing-metamaterials-a-new-frontier-in-technology/ "here"). This project was also published in the Advanced Engineering Materials research journal, and the publication can be downloaded as a pdf here:

Essentially, I constructed lattice of gallium spheres suspended on wires and casted in Dragon Skin (a silicone rubber). By sending a current through a wire, I can selectively melt a row of the lattice and control its stiffness in that specific area. Think of it as 125 gallium balloons fused together. Ultimately, this project served as a proof-of-concept design, a step towards achieving a metamaterial that can locally achieve dramatic changes in stiffness based on wireless control instructions. All the details can be read in the paper above!
