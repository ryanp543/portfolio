    text: "Mechanical Engineering Intern"
---

During the summer of 2017, I got the opportunity to intern at Made In Space, a small company devoted to bringing additive manufacturing technologies to space in order to remove the limitations posed by expensive payload deliveries via rocket. Its website provides a taste of the projects they are involved in.

As an intern, I worked alongside Made In Space engineers to design, construct, and assemble hardware that would eventually be sent to the International Space Station.

Projects for Space Flight

At Made In Space, I worked on upgrading and modifying components for the Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF) 3D printer. I prepared space-flight materials and designed a machine that would expedite the specific procedure of neatly spooling AMF spool canisters with filament. Another one of my primary projects was developing prototype hardware for next generation additive manufacturing technology to be used out in parabolic flight. A description of the project can be found in [this article](https://medium.com/made-in-space/new-space-based-manufacturing-technologies-demonstrated-by-made-in-space-79000e771ac4 "here"). 

"The [Satellite Manufacturing Machine] is a multi-material 3D printer and robotic assembly system. It creates useful electronic devices by additively manufacturing structure and circuit board substrates, robotically placing electronic components (in this case a solar cell, integrated circuits, and a transmitter), and laying down electrically conductive traces."

Note: Due to the somewhat proprietary nature of the projects, pictures of my work are not posted here.
